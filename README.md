                                                     # BankistApp 

BankistApp was created on my way of my learnings javascript from the udemy course that i took,this was created with help of course. 

this is the small online bank app where movements of transaction can be seen,a person can login with his first and last letter of his name  as username and using pin,users and accounts are hardcoded as of now, will try to upgrade  this app in future.

First I took BankistApp idea from the course and then created with help of my learnings from previous sections and took a help from course if i stuck.
